# 9. Function Types

Tags:[ #categorytheory, #functions ]

## Literature Notes
- (pg. 109): Categorically, functions are just a product of the function object `z`, the argument object `a` and a morphism `g` from the product to the result `a`. `(z, a) --g-> b`
- (pg. 111): `curry` is the factorizer; it can produce the factorizing function `h` which takes `z -> (a => b)`
- (pg. 114): A Cartesion Closed Category corresponds to a simply typed lambda calculus and has 3 properties (bonus: the inclusion of the distributive property of products over coproducts is called a _bicartesian closed category_)
    - The terminal object
    - A product of any pair of objects
    - An exponential for any pair of objects
