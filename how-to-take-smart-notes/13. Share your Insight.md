## Literature Notes
1. (pg. 134): Making the decision to enter a permanent note into the slip-box is making a decision about whats important to write about.
2. (pg. 135): The zettelkasten is predicated on the assumption that the aim of this process is producing written artefacts, as opposed to gathering knowledge. This subtle shift in priorities changes a lot, but most importantly it makes writing easier because the slip-box is designed to generate writing topics.
