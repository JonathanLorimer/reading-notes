## Literature Notes
1. (pg. 76): The extensivness, or the brevity of our notes should match the complexity of the text; one should not worry that notes are a uniform length.
2. (pg. 79): When taking notes try to avoid confirmation bias.

4. (pg. 89): One of the most effective methods for learning is _elaboration_.
