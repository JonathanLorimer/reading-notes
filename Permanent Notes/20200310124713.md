The one piece of the zettelkasten method that isn't quite fitting together for me right now are entrypoints into the graphs of notes. I have briefly read about _indexes_ but haven't heard them elaborated in. In my estimation indexes / entrypoints are the crux of an effective zettelkasten system.

The index is the table of contents and the entrypoints are notes that represent a topic and link to other notes. This is a useful way to describe topics because notes can be deprecated in favour of other notes when a topic morphs and changes.
