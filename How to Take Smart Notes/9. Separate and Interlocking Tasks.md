## Literature Notes
1. (pg. 58-63): Don't multitask, the slipbox facilitates this by forcing us to just read, then just write.
2. (pg. 64): Don't be a planner, be an expert.
3. (pg. 67): The slip-box is not perscriptive, but rather gives one the structure to express and navigate thoughts (without restriction). All this free-form thinking is intersperesed with writing tasks for immediate feedback.
4. (pg. 70): Zeigarnik Effect: We cannot stop thinking about unfinished tasks, but have an easy time forgetting them so long as we have noted that we will deal with them later. Note the waiter example, and using this effect to eliminate small tasks and hold on to important ones.
5. (pg. 71): Consider your 3 limited resources: attention (1 focus), short-term memory (7 items), willpower.
