## Literature Notes
1. (pg. 9): When dealing with complexity having a simple structure allows the complexity to build where it is appropriateâ€¦ in the content.
2. (pg. 10): Everything needs to be taken care of for one to let go and immerse themselves in the task at hand. This is where workflow, standardization, and scheduling can help us externalize tasks such that we can free up our working memory.
3. (pg.16, 17): Having a system that is flexible enough to accomodate the idiosyncratic rythm of our individual learning styles is the most important factor in difusing resistance.
4. (pg.20): Luhmann had two slip boxes, one for literature notes, and one for ideas. The literature notes had bibliographic information on the front, and reference notes on the back. He also would have a note that acted as an index.
