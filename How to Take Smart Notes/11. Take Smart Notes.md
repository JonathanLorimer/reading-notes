## Literature Notes
1. (pg. 91): Write brief accounts rather than quotes, this gets you thinking outside of the texts context.
2. (pg. 102): Learning is just making connections between ideas; there is a distinction between 'storage strength' and 'retrieval strength'.
3. (pg. 105): Learning is tantamount to understanding and being able to trigger that understanding with the correct cues. This is why its valuable to have extensive networks that allow one to situate desiderata deeply, with many connections.
4. (pg. 106): The slip box, by not sorting on topic, removes barriers to connections that might otherwise have been made.
