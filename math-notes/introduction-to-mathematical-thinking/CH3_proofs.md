# Proofs

### Exercises 3.2.1
1. Prove that cube root 3 is irrational
  - assume that cube root 3 is rational
  - 3 = p^2 / q^2
  - p^2 = 3q^2
  - there is some (3r)^2 = q^2
  - therefore both p and q must be divisible by 3

2. We can prove that the root of N is sometimes rational:
  - assume that root 9 is irrational
  - `9 = p^2 / q^2` such that every p and q have a common factor
  - 9 = p^2 / q^2
  - 9 = 3^2 / 1^2
  - aka if the root of 9 is an integer
  - therefore 9 is a rational
  - however this is not true in certain cases; when N is a perfect root i.e. the root of the x^2 where x is a natural number i.e. 9
  -

3. every N such that p is an integer and p^2 = N is a rational root i.e. a perfect root
