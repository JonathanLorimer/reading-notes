# What is Mathematics ?

## Preface
- Distinction between `doing math` and `thinking mathematically`; procedural mathematics contra abstract mathematics
- Interestingly thinks that mathematical logic provides a good model for mathematical thinking, but is not the best way to develop practical skills

## 1.1 More than arithmetic
- Dramatic growth of mathematics started in the 1980s with the emergence of the new definition of mathematics as the _science of patterns_

## 1.2 Mathematical notation
- Symbols are important for conveying meaning efficiently, but are no more mathematics than musical notation is music

## 1.3 Modern college-level mathematics
- "Mathematical objects were no longer thought of as given primarily by formulas, but rather as carriers of conceptual properties." - pp. 5
- Dirichlet abstracted the concept of a function from one based on algebra and numbers to a more general conception; a rule that takes mathematical objects as input and produces new ones as output
    - Mathematicians began to study the properties of abstract functions i.e. _injectivity_

## 1.4 Why do you have to learn this stuff?
- Two categories of math that are used in a career
    1. given a mathematically formulated problem can you solve it?
    2. take a new problem, identify key features, describe it mathematically, and analyze the problem precisely
- The author predicts an increasing demand in type 2 abilities
