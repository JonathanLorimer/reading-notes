My process in university was to take meticulous literature notes, but I never made connections, or if I did it was sparingly. Just the literature notes served me extremely well

I am worried that the zettelkasten approach will lead to written artefacts that look like s√∂nke ahrens. The book seems to be an amalgamation of what the author found important, but is really unimportant to me. Chapters are saturated with connections and tangents that, I am sure, mean something to the author, but just don't land with me.

My two biggest problems with the book were that it goes into way too much detail on spurious connections, and doesn't really investigate the shortcomings of the zettelkasten system.

I should elaborate on the technicalities of the slip-boxes
